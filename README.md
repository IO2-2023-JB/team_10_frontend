  Production build will be generated in the `build` directory. It is a static HTML/CSS/JS page which can be hosted with any web server.

## Code formatting

This project uses Prettier for code formatting. Please always format your code before commiting.

How to format:

- VS Code extension (recommended)

  Install the Prettier VS Code extension and set it as the default formatter (`CTRL+SHIFT+P` > `Format Document`).

  Enabling `Format on save` in VS Code settings is also recommended.

- Terminal
  ```
  yarn global add prettier
  prettier --write .
  ```
## Code quality

This command should be run before each commit to ensure code quality

```
yarn lint
```

This runs a TypeScript check and an ESLint check

## Bundle size analysis

This project uses `rollup-plugin-visualizer` which lets you easily analyze the production build bundle (sizes of all dependencies). Run `yarn build` to generate a report into the `stats.html` file. Open the file in a browser to see the report.
